# Notifications

Makima can tell you when a session finishes or needs your input. This is useful
when you move to another terminal while Makima works.

Notifications are enabled by default. Makima does not notify while it knows
that its terminal has focus.

Makima uses these messages:

- `Agent turn complete` or a preview of the response, up to 200 characters.
- `Permission requested: <tool>` for a permission prompt.
- `Authentication required` when authentication needs attention.
- `Question requested` for a question prompt.
- `Plan ready` when a plan is ready.

Response previews can appear in your operating system's notification history.
Makima does not include tool arguments, permission scopes, question bodies, plan
content, or error details. Use `bell` for a message-free alert, or use `off`
to disable notifications if response text should not reach notification
history.

## Configuration

Set `ui.notifications` in `~/.config/makima/init.lua`:

```lua
maki.setup({
  ui = {
    notifications = "auto",
  },
})
```

| Value | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `auto` | Use OSC 9 in a supported terminal. Use BEL otherwise. |
| `osc9` | Always send an OSC 9 notification. |
| `bell` | Always send the terminal bell. |
| `off` | Do not send notifications. |

`auto` supports Ghostty, iTerm2, Kitty, Warp, and WezTerm. An unknown terminal
uses BEL. Your terminal settings decide whether BEL makes a sound or shows a
visual alert.

Makima also recognizes `xterm-ghostty` and `xterm-kitty` from `TERM`. This lets
OSC 9 work when an SSH connection does not preserve `TERM_PROGRAM`.

## tmux

tmux needs both of these settings:

```tmux
set -g focus-events on
set -g allow-passthrough all
```

Use `allow-passthrough all`, not `allow-passthrough on`. The `on` value permits
passthrough only while the Makima pane is visible. tmux drops the notification
after you change to another tmux window.

Add the settings to `~/.tmux.conf`, then reload the file or restart tmux.

## Other terminal multiplexers

Makima wraps OSC 9 for GNU screen. GNU screen does not pass terminal focus
events to Makima, so Makima does not suppress notifications there. A notification
can appear while the GNU screen window has focus.

Makima sends OSC 9 directly through Zellij.

## Focus on Windows

This terminal focus protocol is not available on Windows. Makima treats the
terminal as unfocused so an explicit `bell` or `osc9` setting still works.
